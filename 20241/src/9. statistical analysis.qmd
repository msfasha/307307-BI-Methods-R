Here’s a comprehensive tutorial for performing core inferential statistical analysis in R using your apartment prices dataset. This includes t-tests, chi-square tests, and regression analysis to make sense of the data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **R Statistical Analysis Tutorial**

#### **1. Importing and Exploring the Dataset**

Begin by loading and understanding the data.

```{R}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Read the dataset
data <- read.csv("data/
```

```{R}

```

```{apartment_prices.csv")}

# View the first few rows
head(data)

# Summary statistics
summary(data)

# Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(data))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **2. Descriptive Statistics**

Compute measures of central tendency and dispersion for key variables.

```{R}
# Descriptive statistics
mean(data$Price)
median(data$Price)
sd(data$Price)
var(data$Price)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3. Visualizing the Data**

Explore distributions and relationships.

```{R}
# Histogram of Prices
ggplot(data, aes(x = Price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Apartment Prices", x = "Price", y = "Frequency")

# Boxplot of Prices by City
ggplot(data, aes(x = City, y = Price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "orange") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Apartment Prices by City", x = "City", y = "Price")

# Scatterplot of Price vs Square Area
ggplot(data, aes(x = Square_Area, y = Price)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Price vs Square Area", x = "Square Area", y = "Price")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **4. T-Tests**

Perform a t-test to compare mean apartment prices between two cities (e.g., Amman vs. Aqaba).

```{R}
# Subset data for two cities
amman <- data %>% filter(City == "Amman") %>% pull(Price)
aqaba <- data %>% filter(City == "Aqaba") %>% pull(Price)

# Two-sample t-test
t_test <- t.test(amman, aqaba, var.equal = TRUE)
print(t_test)
```

**Interpretation:** - If the p-value is \<0.05, the difference in mean prices between the two cities is statistically significant.

#### **5. ANOVA Test**

The ANOVA test examines if the mean apartment prices significantly differ across the three cities: Amman, Aqaba, and Irbid

```{R}
# Perform ANOVA
anova_model <- aov(Price ~ City, data = data)
summary(anova_model)
```

-   **Degrees of Freedom (Df):** The ANOVA test compares the variability between groups (cities) to the variability within groups (residuals).

    -   **City Df = 2:** Indicates three cities are being compared.

    -   **Residuals Df = 497:** Refers to the remaining observations.

-   **Sum of Squares (Sum Sq):**

    -   Variability due to cities: 3.106×10103.106 \times 10^{10}3.106×1010.

    -   Residual variability: 1.718×10111.718 \times 10^{11}1.718×1011.

-   **F-Value:** 44.9444.9444.94, which is the ratio of the mean square between groups to the mean square within groups. A high F-value suggests substantial variability between group means relative to within-group variability.

-   **P-Value:** **\< 2e-16**, which is highly significant. This confirms that at least one city's mean price differs significantly from the others.

The Tukey test identifies which specific city pairs have significant differences in mean prices.

```{R}
# Perform Tukey's post-hoc test if ANOVA is significant
tukey_test <- TukeyHSD(anova_model)
print(tukey_test)
```

**Key Findings:**

-   **Aqaba vs. Amman:** Mean price in Aqaba is significantly lower than in Amman by **11,976 JDs** (p<0.001p < 0.001p\<0.001).

-   **Irbid vs. Amman:** Mean price in Irbid is significantly lower than in Amman by **18,789 JDs** (p<0.001p < 0.001p\<0.001).

-   **Irbid vs. Aqaba:** Mean price in Irbid is significantly lower than in Aqaba by **6,813 JDs** (p=0.003p = 0.003p=0.003).

#### **Interpretation:**

1.  **Overall ANOVA:** Apartment prices vary significantly between cities.

2.  **Pairwise Comparisons:**

    -   Amman has the highest mean apartment prices.

    -   Aqaba prices are significantly higher than those in Irbid.

    -   Irbid has the lowest apartment prices among the three cities.

### Insights

-   **Amman:** Premium city with significantly higher apartment prices.

-   **Aqaba:** Mid-range city with prices lower than Amman but higher than Irbid.

-   **Irbid:** Most affordable city, with significantly lower apartment prices compared to both Amman and Aqaba.

This analysis provides critical insights for stakeholders aiming to understand regional price variations in the apartment market. It can be seamlessly integrated into a Quarto document to highlight key urban differences in property economics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **6. Chi-Square Test**

Test for independence between categorical variables, such as city and number of rooms.

```{R}
# Create a contingency table
room_city_table <- table(data$City, data$Num_Rooms)

# Perform chi-square test
chi_sq_test <- chisq.test(room_city_table)
print(chi_sq_test)
```

**Interpretation:** - A significant p-value (\<0.05) suggests a relationship between the city and the number of rooms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **7. Correlation Analysis**

Analyze the relationship between numeric variables.

```{R}
# Correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(data %>% select(Square_Area, Num_Rooms, Age_of_Building, Floor_Level, Price))
print(cor_matrix)

# Visualize correlations
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "circle")
```

**Use Case:** - High correlation values indicate strong relationships, useful for regression analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **8. Regression Analysis**

##### **8.1 Simple Linear Regression**

Predict apartment prices based on square area.

```{R}
# Simple linear regression
lm_model <- lm(Price ~ Square_Area, data = data)
summary(lm_model)

# Visualization
ggplot(data, aes(x = Square_Area, y = Price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Linear Regression: Price vs Square Area", x = "Square Area", y = "Price")
```

##### **8.2 Multiple Linear Regression**

Incorporate additional predictors to improve the model.

```{R}
# Multiple linear regression
mlm_model <- lm(Price ~ Square_Area + Num_Rooms + Age_of_Building + Floor_Level, data = data)
summary(mlm_model)

# Residual diagnostics
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(mlm_model)
```

**Evaluation Metrics:** - Check ( R\^2 ) for model fit. - Residual plots should show no patterns (indicating good fit).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **9. Prediction and Model Evaluation**

Split the data into training and testing sets for better evaluation.

```{R}
# Split data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
train_indices <- sample(1:nrow(data), size = 0.7 * nrow(data))
train <- data[train_indices, ]
test <- data[-train_indices, ]

# Train model on training data
train_model <- lm(Price ~ Square_Area + Num_Rooms + Age_of_Building + Floor_Level, data = train)

# Predict on testing data
predictions <- predict(train_model, test)

# Evaluate model performance
rmse <- sqrt(mean((test$Price - predictions)^2))
print(paste("Root Mean Squared Error:", rmse))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **10. Conclusion**

-   **T-Tests:** Compared prices between cities, showing statistical significance of differences.
-   **Chi-Square Test:** Explored the relationship between city and room counts.
-   **Regression Analysis:** Identified predictors of price and assessed model accuracy.
-   **Visualization:** Highlighted trends in price, area, and city distributions.

This unified analysis provides actionable insights into your apartment price dataset and can be directly incorporated into a Quarto document.
