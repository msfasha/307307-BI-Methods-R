### **Statistics Assignment**

#### **Instructions**
- Analyze the provided dataset using R.
- Answer all questions, supporting your findings with charts, tables, and explanations.
- Submit a well-structured report (PDF format), including all code and outputs.

### **Part 1: Descriptive Statistics**
1. **Basic Summary**:
   - For the following columns: Age, Mid-exam score, and GPA:
     - Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, range, minimum, and maximum.
     - Identify the most frequent (mode) value.

2. **Frequency Distributions**:
   - Create frequency tables for:
     - Gender
     - Year of study
     - Distance from home to the university

3. **Percentile Analysis**:
   - Calculate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for GPA.

### **Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Age Distribution**:
   - Plot a histogram or density plot for the Age column.
   - Answer:
     - What is the most common age?
     - Are there any outliers?

5. **Satisfaction Levels**:
   - Compare the satisfaction levels (university experience and BI major) across genders using boxplots.
   - Identify which group has the highest and lowest satisfaction ratings.

6. **Home Distance vs. Recommendation**:
   - Investigate the relationship between home distance from the university and the likelihood of recommending the university using:
     - A scatterplot or boxplot
     - Statistical summary (mean and median likelihood by distance group)

7. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Calculate and visualize correlations between:
     - Mid-exam score
     - GPA
     - University satisfaction
     - Recommendation likelihood
   - Highlight the strongest relationships.

### **Part 3: Inferential Statistics**
8. **Hypothesis Testing (T-Test)**:
   - Test if there is a significant difference in GPA between:
     - Male and female students
     - Students who work versus those who don’t

9. **ANOVA**:
   - Analyze if the year of study has a significant effect on:
     - GPA
     - Satisfaction with the university experience

10. **Chi-Square Test**:
    - Test if there is an association between:
      - High school education type and GPA categories (e.g., low, medium, high)
      - Working status and satisfaction with the university experience

---

### **Part 4: Regression Analysis**
11. **Simple Linear Regression**:
    - Build a model predicting GPA using the mid-exam score.
    - Assess:
      - R-squared value
      - Significance of the predictor

12. **Multiple Linear Regression**:
    - Extend the model to include:
      - Satisfaction with the university
      - Satisfaction with the BI major
      - Type of work (encoded appropriately if categorical)
    - Interpret:
      - Coefficients for each predictor
      - Overall model fit

13. **Logistic Regression**:
    - Build a logistic regression model to predict whether students would recommend the university (Yes/No) based on:
      - Satisfaction levels
      - Type of work
      - Year of study

### **Part 5: Specific Questions**
14. **Key Insights**:
    - Answer the following:
      - What is the average GPA for students in each year of study?
      - Which group has the highest average satisfaction with the university?
      - Are students who live closer (<5 KM) more likely to recommend the university compared to those farther away?

15. **Outliers**:
    - Identify potential outliers in:
      - GPA
      - Mid-exam scores
    - Use boxplots or IQR methods to justify your findings.

### **Part 6: Bonus Tasks**
16. **Clustering**:
    - Perform clustering (e.g., K-means) on:
      - GPA
      - Mid-exam score
      - Satisfaction levels
    - Analyze the clusters:
      - How many clusters are optimal?
      - What characterizes each cluster?

17. **Interactive Visualization**:
    - Create an interactive dashboard (using R’s Shiny or Python’s Plotly/Dash) to visualize:
      - GPA distributions
      - Satisfaction levels by group
      - Relationships between predictors and outcomes
