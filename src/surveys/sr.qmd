### **Assignment: Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing**

**Objective**:  
Analyze the survey dataset to gain insights using EDA and hypothesis testing in R.

---

#### **Instructions**:
1. Use the provided dataset.
2. Perform the tasks listed below in **R**.
3. Submit your R script and a brief report summarizing your findings.

### **Tasks**

#### **Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
1. **Data Overview**:
   - Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
   - Check for missing values and handle them.

2. **Summary Statistics**:
   - Compute descriptive statistics for numeric columns (`High School Average`, `MID Exam Score`, `GPA`, etc.).
   - Summarize categorical variables (`Gender`, `Year of Study`, etc.).

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Gender distribution (bar chart).
   - GPA distribution (histogram).
   - Satisfaction levels for the university and the Business Intelligence major (box plots or bar charts).
   - NPS categories (promoters, passives, detractors) as a bar chart.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Compute correlations between numeric variables.
   - Visualize correlations with a heatmap.

#### **Part 2: Hypothesis Testing**
1. **T-Test**:
   - Compare average GPA between students who work and those who do not.
   - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: No difference in GPA between the two groups.

2. **Chi-Square Test**:
   - Test whether gender is associated with satisfaction levels.
   - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: Gender and satisfaction are independent.

3. **ANOVA**:
   - Test if satisfaction levels differ by `Year of Study`.
   - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: No difference in satisfaction levels across years.

4. **NPS Analysis**:
   - Calculate the NPS score:
     - Promoters: Scores 9–10.
     - Passives: Scores 7–8.
     - Detractors: Scores 0–6.
   - Report insights.
